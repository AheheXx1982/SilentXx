## Strategy Overview

The Bull Call Spread strategy is a limited risk, limited reward options strategy suitable for expecting a moderate rise in the underlying asset price. This strategy is constructed by buying a call option with a lower strike price and simultaneously selling a call option with a higher strike price.

## Strategy Construction

- Buy a call option with a lower strike price
- Sell a call option with a higher strike price
- Both options have the same expiration date
- Usually receive a net premium expense when establishing the strategy

## Profit/Loss Characteristics

### Maximum Profit

Maximum Profit = Higher Strike Price - Lower Strike Price - Net Premium Expense

### Maximum Loss

Maximum Loss = Net Premium Expense

### Break-even Point

Break-even Point = Lower Strike Price + Net Premium Expense

## Applicable Scenarios

1. **Moderate Bull Market**: Expecting the underlying asset price to rise slightly
2. **Declining Volatility Environment**: The strategy benefits from declining implied volatility
3. **Cost Control Needs**: Reduce strategy costs by selling options

## Strategy Advantages

- Lower cost than simply buying call options
- Limited and defined risk
- Clear profit curve

## Strategy Disadvantages

- Limited profit, upside potential is restricted
- Requires accurate judgment of the rise magnitude
- Time value decay has a negative impact on the strategy
