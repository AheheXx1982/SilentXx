## Introduction to Futures Trading

Futures trading is a financial derivatives trading method that allows traders to profit by predicting asset price movements, with a leverage effect.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Leverage

- Leverage can amplify profits, but also amplifies risks
- Common leverage multiples: 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x

### 2. Margin

- Funds required to open a position, divided into initial margin and maintenance margin
- Insufficient margin will lead to forced liquidation

### 3. Position Direction

- Going long (Long): Expecting price increases
- Going short (Short): Expecting price decreases

## Risk Management

### 1. Stop-Loss Setting

- Set reasonable stop-loss points to limit losses
- Use trailing stop-loss to protect profits

### 2. Position Control

- Don't invest all funds in a single trade
- Reasonably allocate positions based on account funds

### 3. Emotion Control

- Avoid emotional trading
- Develop and strictly execute trading plans

## Practical Recommendations

Beginners are advised to start with small amounts of capital and low leverage, gradually accumulating experience before increasing investment.
