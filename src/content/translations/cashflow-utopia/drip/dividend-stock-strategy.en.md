By investing in high-dividend stocks globally, build investment portfolios that can continuously generate cash flow and achieve long-term stable wealth growth.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dividend Yield

- Select companies with reasonable and sustainable dividend yields
- Avoid "dividend traps" that invest solely for high dividends

### 2. Company Fundamentals

- Solid financial condition
- Sustainable profitability
- Leading industry position

### 3. Diversified Investment

- Geographic diversification: Invest in stocks from different countries and regions
- Industry diversification: Cover multiple industries to reduce risk

## Selection Criteria

### Financial Indicators

- Dividend yield > 3%
- Reasonable debt ratio
- Stable profit growth

### Industry Preferences

- Utilities
- Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
- Consumer goods
- Financial services

## Rotation Strategy

Based on market environment and individual stock performance, regularly adjust holdings, sell underperforming stocks, and buy high-dividend stocks with more potential.

## Risk Warning

Dividends may be reduced or cancelled, and stock prices may also decline. Investors need to pay attention to changes in company fundamentals.
