## Strategy Overview

Grid trading is an automated buy-low-sell-high trading strategy within a preset price range, particularly suitable for 震荡 markets.

## Core Principles

Grid trading sets multiple buy and sell orders within a defined price range, automatically executing trades when prices hit these orders, thereby profiting from market fluctuations.

## Setup Key Points

### 1. Choosing Suitable Trading Pairs

- Cryptocurrency pairs with high volatility
- Coins with sufficient trading volume

### 2. Determining Price Range

- Identify support and resistance levels based on technical analysis
- Consider market sentiment and news event impacts

### 3. Setting Grid Density

- Overly dense grids increase trading frequency but reduce single-trade profits
- Overly sparse grids may miss trading opportunities

## Risk Warnings

While grid trading performs well in 震荡 markets, it may face significant risks in trending markets and requires timely strategy adjustments.
